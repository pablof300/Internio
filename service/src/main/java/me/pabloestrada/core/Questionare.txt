1.What are your thoughts on sharing and borrowing?
Let’s share everything - no need to ask
You can probably borrow my stuff - just ask first
I won’t say no in an emergency - I prefer to not share
Sorry, I don’t ever lend my stuff to others

Take turns buying
Split costs evenly
Buy our own items separately

Any time of day or night
During the day and evening, but not at night
During the daytime only please
I need the silence of a library

7. What’s your guest policy?
The more the merrier! Guests all the time
Not a problem, just ask for a heads up
One or two guests are okay occasionally
On a rare occasion guests are fine
I prefer no guests coming over

8. How do you feel about alcohol?
I’m game for drinks during the week
I save it for the weekends
I drink a few times a month

I don’t drink, and I’d like an alcohol-free home

Always!
Often
